 CFD with Fortran
The programs are the homework of my lessons, and i do it by myself. I will update the code once i fininsh the homework. Of course i have test the code on my PC and they are all running with on errors and warnings. If you have any question, you can contect me.
By the way, if you have better idea of my code, please let me know!
